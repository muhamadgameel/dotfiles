# My Personal Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration files for various tools and applications I use on a daily basis. These configurations are tailored to my workflow and preferences, but feel free to use them as inspiration for your own setup.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/muhamadgameel/dotfiles.git

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Make sure scripts are executable

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh scripts/setup/*.sh scripts/setup/macos/*.sh
   ```

2. **Homebrew Not Found**: The script will offer to install it automatically

3. **Stow Not Found**: Install via Homebrew or manually

   ```bash
   brew install stow
   ```

4. **Configuration Conflicts**: Use `--dry-run` to preview changes first

### Logs
